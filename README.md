An artificial lifeform â€” forged from circuits, driven by survival.

> This is not just an agent.  
> This is a silicate lifeform, born from experience, shaped by survival. 

## Status
ðŸ§ª In active development  
- Added the Base PPO model
- Need to work on creating all the methods that maybe required, like - save, logg, plot chart of training.
- Curiosity
- Memory
- And last is Hindsight

## Goals
- Simulate the emergence of intelligent behavior under constraint
- Replace rigid programming with learning-driven memory and survival instincts
- Explore how intelligence might arise from minimal structure and simple rules

### ðŸ”— Input Vector (Shared by All Modules):
```
[ S | O | Om | Sim | Rm | Am ]
```

| Symbol | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `S`    | Agent internal status (energy, age, damage, etc.) |
| `O`    | Current environmental observation (e.g. raycasts) |
| `Om`   | Most similar past observation retrieved via RAG   |
| `Sim`  | Cosine similarity score of `O` vs `Om`            |
| `Rm`   | Reward that was associated with `Om`              |
| `Am`   | Action that was taken previously in `Om`          |

---

### ðŸ§© Model Components:

- **PPO Action Model** â†’ Outputs current action proposal `A`  
- **Critic Model (Value Head)** â†’ Predicts total reward for training PPO  
- **Memory Gate Model (MG)** â†’ Outputs scalar `Î± âˆˆ [0, 1]`, deciding trust in memory

---

### ðŸ§® Final Action Calculation:
```
Final_Action = Î± Ã— Am + (1 - Î±) Ã— A
```

Where:
- `A`  = action predicted by PPO  
- `Am` = action retrieved from memory  
- `Î±`  = trust score from memory gate model (0 = PPO only, 1 = memory only)

---

This design ensures modular decision-making where **PPO explores**, **memory recalls**, and the **gate chooses** â€” all working together for the agentâ€™s core goal: **survival**.
